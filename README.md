### Welcome to the Workout application!

Personal trainers can consult all the information (current and historical) about their students' measures and limitations so that they can create the best workout for each student considering all those information.

The students can consult their information as well, see their progress and workout.

### Tech stack

This application is built with React framework in TypeScript, currently, it only has unit tests using jest.

> :warning: **Disclaimer** since this project is a personal work to improve and show the author front-end skills, it doesn't have back-end API. But, it has workaround to mock and simulate async requests on the `mock-back-end` directory. The front-end app should deal with back-and as a black box and be very uncoupled from its implementation, then, if someday the author decides to create a back-end API, the necessity to change front-end code will be minimal.

### Instructions

To install the project it's required node and running `npm i`
After installation, you can start the app in cmd `npm start`
To run the tests, you can execute `npm test` or use the Jest Runner plugin in vscode.
